/// This Collection must store each individual waypoint in the game.
/// For each waypoint, it will check the NPCs that have been assigned to it, 
/// after validating if the npc has a valid prefab and if they are not duplicated, 
/// it will add them to the list, assigning the waypoint to the NPC.
/// 
/// You should not have to manually assign waypoints to the NPC, but the other way around.
/// 
/// If you need to change a NPC address(waypoint), make sure to delete its waypoint first, then delete the NPC 
/// from the waypoint residents list. After that, you can assign the NPC to a new waypoint, then refresh the Collection.
